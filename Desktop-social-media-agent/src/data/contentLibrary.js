      title: "The Science of Sleep: Why Your Brain Needs 7-9 Hours",
      content: "Your brain literally cleans itself while you sleep. During deep sleep, your glymphatic system flushes out toxins and waste products that build up during the day. This includes amyloid-beta, the protein linked to Alzheimer's disease. Poor sleep isn't just about feeling tired - it's about long-term brain health.",
      science: "During sleep, brain cells shrink by 60%, creating space for cerebrospinal fluid to wash away metabolic waste.",
      tips: "Cool room (65-68Â°F), dark environment, no screens 1 hour before bed, consistent sleep schedule.",

      title: "Neuroplasticity: Your Brain Can Change at Any Age",
      content: "The old belief that adult brains are fixed? Completely false. Neuroplasticity research shows that our brains continue forming new neural pathways throughout life.

      title: "The Gut-Brain Connection: How Your Microbiome Affects Mood",
      content: "95% of your serotonin is produced in your gut, not your brain. Your gut bacteria communicate directly with your brain via the vagus nerve, influencing mood, anxiety, and decision-making. This is why you get 'gut feelings' and why stress affects digestion.",
      science: "The gut contains 500 million neurons - more than the spinal cord. It's called the 'second brain' for good reason.",
      tips: "Eat fermented foods, reduce sugar, manage stress, include prebiotic fiber, consider probiotic supplements.",
