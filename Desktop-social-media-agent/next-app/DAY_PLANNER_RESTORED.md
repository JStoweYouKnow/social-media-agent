### Improvements Over Old App

## 📋 Data Structure

Posts displayed in the planner have this structure:

  date: string;              // ISO date "2025-01-15"
  dayName: string;           // "monday", "tuesday", etc.
  contentType: string;       // "recipes", "workouts", etc.
  content: {
    title: string;
    description?: string;
  };
  variations: {
    instagram: string;       // Full Instagram post
    linkedin: string;        // Full LinkedIn post
    facebook: string;        // Full Facebook post
  };
  status: string;            // "draft", "scheduled", etc.
}
```
