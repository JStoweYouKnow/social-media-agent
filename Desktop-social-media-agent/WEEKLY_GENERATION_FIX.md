# Weekly Generation Fix - "undefined" Error

## Issue
When generating weekly posts, the error message showed: **"Failed to generate week: undefined"**

## Root Causes

### 1. **Missing Error Message Handling**
The API returns `success: false` with an `errors` array when some posts fail to generate, but no `message` field. The frontend was only checking `data.message`, which was undefined.

**API Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "posts": [ /* generated posts */ ],
  "errors": [
    {"day": "Tuesday", "error": "Missing data for source: events"},
    {"day": "Sunday", "error": "Missing data for source: desserts"}
  ],
  "startDay": "Monday",
  "count": 5
}
```

### 2. **Wrong Source Key Name**
Frontend was using `sweets` but API expects `desserts`:

**Before:**
```javascript
sweets: { title: "Sunday Reflection", reflection: "Gratitude practice" }
```

**After:**
```javascript
desserts: mindfulnessPosts[0] || { title: "Sunday Reflection", reflection: "Gratitude practice", content: "Take time to reflect on the week" }
```

## Solutions Applied

### 1. **Improved Error Handling** (Lines 5317-5333)

**Before:**
```javascript
if (data.success) {
  // Show success
} else {
  console.error('Weekly generation failed:', data.message);
  alert(`Failed to generate week: ${data.message}`); // undefined!
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (data.success) {
  setWeeklyPosts(data.posts);
  alert(`Successfully generated ${data.posts.length} posts for the week!`);
} else {
  // Handle errors - could be from message or errors array
  let errorMsg = data.message;
  if (!errorMsg && data.errors && data.errors.length > 0) {
    errorMsg = `Generated ${data.count || 0} posts with ${data.errors.length} errors:\n` + 
               data.errors.map(e => `${e.day}: ${e.error}`).join('\n');
  }
  
  // Still show the posts that were generated successfully
  if (data.posts && data.posts.length > 0) {
    setWeeklyPosts(data.posts);
    alert(`Partial success: Generated ${data.posts.length} out of 7 posts.\n\nMissing data for:\n${data.errors.map(e => `- ${e.day}`).join('\n')}\n\nPlease add content for these days in the Topic Bank.`);
  } else {
    alert(`Failed to generate week: ${errorMsg || 'Unknown error'}`);
  }
}
```

### 2. **Fixed Source Key Names** (Lines 5301-5307)

**Changed:**
- `sweets` → `desserts`
- Added fallback data with all required fields
- Used appropriate state (mindfulnessPosts for desserts/reflection)

**Updated Content Data:**
```javascript
const contentData = {
  quotes: motivationalContent[0] || { 
    quote: "Progress, not perfection", 
    author: "Unknown", 
    context: "Start your week with intention" 
  },
  events: { 
    title: "Community Meetup", 
    date: "Wednesday", 
    time: "6:45pm", 
    location: "All Saints Church" 
  },
  insights: realEstateTips[0] || { 
    tip: "Market insight for the week", 
    context: "Real estate trends" 
  },
  recipes: recipes[0] || { 
    title: "Weekly Recipe", 
    description: "Delicious meal", 
    ingredients: "Fresh ingredients" 
  },
  workouts: workouts[0] || { 
    title: "Weekly Workout", 
    exercises: "Full body routine", 
    duration: "30 minutes" 
  },
  desserts: mindfulnessPosts[0] || { 
    title: "Sunday Reflection", 
    reflection: "Gratitude practice", 
    content: "Take time to reflect on the week" 
  }
};
```

## Expected Source Keys (from API)

Based on `/api/contentSchedule.js`:

| Day | Type | Source Key | Required Fields |
|-----|------|------------|-----------------|
| Monday | Motivational | `quotes` | quote, author, context |
| Tuesday | Event Reminder | `events` | title, date, time, location |
| Wednesday | Event Day | `events` | title, date, time, location |
| Thursday | Real Estate | `insights` | tip, context |
| Friday | Recipe | `recipes` | title, description, ingredients |
| Saturday | Workout | `workouts` | title, exercises, duration |
| Sunday | Reflection | `desserts` | title, reflection, content |

## New Behavior

### Scenario 1: All Data Present
```
✅ Success
Alert: "Successfully generated 7 posts for the week!"
Result: All 7 posts added to calendar
```

### Scenario 2: Some Data Missing (Most Common)
```
⚠️ Partial Success
Alert: "Partial success: Generated 5 out of 7 posts.

Missing data for:
- Tuesday
- Sunday

Please add content for these days in the Topic Bank."

Result: 5 posts added to calendar, user knows what's missing
```

### Scenario 3: API Error
```
❌ Error
Alert: "Failed to generate week: [actual error message]"
Result: No posts added, clear error shown
```

### Scenario 4: Network Error
```
❌ Network Error
Alert: "Error generating weekly posts. Make sure the API server is running."
Result: No posts added, connectivity issue indicated
```

## Testing

### Test with Empty State:
1. Clear all content from Topic Bank
2. Click "Generate Week"
3. Should see: "Partial success: Generated 1 out of 7 posts..." (only Monday with default quote)

### Test with Partial Data:
1. Add a recipe to Topic Bank
2. Click "Generate Week"
3. Should see: "Partial success: Generated 2 out of 7 posts..." (Monday + Friday)

### Test with Full Data:
1. Add content for all categories
2. Click "Generate Week"
3. Should see: "Successfully generated 7 posts for the week!"
