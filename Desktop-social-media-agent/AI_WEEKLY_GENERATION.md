## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Be specific about topics
- Mention themes or events
- Include variety (recipes, tips, motivation)
- Specify audience if relevant
- Mention seasonal or timely content

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Use vague descriptions like "good posts"
- Over-constrain (let AI be creative)
- Forget to mention #ProjectComfort alignment
- Ignore your audience preferences

### Examples:

**Good Prompt:**
```
"Create engaging posts about sustainable home improvements, 
 energy-saving tips, eco-friendly recipes, and green living 
 motivation for environmentally conscious homeowners"
```

**Poor Prompt:**
```
"Make some posts"
```
